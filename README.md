# Smart Obstacle Avoidance and Bluetooth Controlled Vehicle  

## Project Overview  
Welcome to the Smart Obstacle Avoidance and Bluetooth Controlled Vehicle project! This Arduino-based creation combines ultrasonic sensors, servo motors, Bluetooth communication, and teamwork to bring a robot to life. Whether it's avoiding obstacles or responding to your smartphone commands, this bot is here to impress!  

## 🚀 Setup Instructions  

1. **Hardware Setup**:  
   - Attach the ultrasonic sensor to `A0` (Echo) and `A1` (Trig).  
   - Connect the servo motor to pin `10`.  
   - Connect the L293D motor driver to four motors and assign motor channels: `1, 2, 3, 4`.  
   - Pair the Bluetooth module to `A4` (RX) and `A5` (TX).  

2. **Software Setup**:  
   - Install the Arduino IDE (if not already installed).  
   - Add the following libraries:  
     - `Servo.h`  
     - `AFMotor.h`  
     - `SoftwareSerial.h`  
   - Load the code into your Arduino board.  

3. **Bluetooth Pairing**:  
   - Pair your phone with the Bluetooth module (use apps like Arduino Bluetooth Controller).  
   - Control the robot with commands:  
     - `F` for Forward  
     - `B` for Backward  
     - `L` for Left  
     - `R` for Right  

4. **Testing Obstacle Avoidance**:  
   - Place obstacles within a 14 cm range.  
   - Watch as the robot intelligently navigates around them!  

5. **Power Up**:  
   - Use a battery pack to supply power to the motors and Arduino board.

## 🧠 Skills Learned  

1. **Hardware Integration**:  
   Mastered the art of wiring sensors, motors, and Bluetooth modules.  

2. **Arduino Programming**:  
   Learned to use libraries (`Servo.h`, `AFMotor.h`, `SoftwareSerial.h`) and implement logic for obstacle avoidance.  

3. **Problem Solving**:  
   Debugged wiring issues, fine-tuned motor speed, and improved ultrasonic sensing accuracy.  

4. **Teamwork**:  
   - Divided roles: hardware assembly, coding, and testing.  
   - Collaborated on debugging and refining the bot’s performance.
