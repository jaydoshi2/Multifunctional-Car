# Smart Obstacle Avoidance and Bluetooth Controlled Vehicle  

## Project Overview  
Welcome to the Smart Obstacle Avoidance and Bluetooth Controlled Vehicle project! This Arduino-based creation combines ultrasonic sensors, servo motors, Bluetooth communication, and teamwork to bring a robot to life. Whether it's avoiding obstacles or responding to your smartphone commands, this bot is here to impress!  

## üöÄ Setup Instructions  

1. **Hardware Setup**:  
   - Attach the ultrasonic sensor to `A0` (Echo) and `A1` (Trig).  
   - Connect the servo motor to pin `10`.  
   - Connect the L293D motor driver to four motors and assign motor channels: `1, 2, 3, 4`.  
   - Pair the Bluetooth module to `A4` (RX) and `A5` (TX).  

2. **Software Setup**:  
   - Install the Arduino IDE (if not already installed).  
   - Add the following libraries:  
     - `Servo.h`  
     - `AFMotor.h`  
     - `SoftwareSerial.h`  
   - Load the code into your Arduino board.
